This project is to estimate burn severity in Canadain forests with three major aspects:

- Data managment:

1.DataPreparation_EachYear.R;
2.DataPreparation_EachEcozoneYear.R;
3.Jenks_Ecozones.R;
4.MajorClassSamples.R.
  
- Model building (summay of models):
  
5.ModelBuilding_Classification.R;
6.ConsensusAlgorithm.R;
7.ModelAccuracy_VariableImportance.R.

- Model application (burn severity estimates & summary):
  
8.40yrEstimates.R;
9.AnnualNumberofDays_TemporalChanges.R;
10.MostSevereCondition.R.
